        <h2> Why First Aid is Important </h2>
      
            <h4> •	It Helps You Stay Prepared</h4> 
            
            <p>
              The goal of first aid is twofold. First, it helps you recognize the signs that someone actually needs help and, 
              second, it prepares you to respond when minutes matter. Remember, an emergency can happen when you least expect it, whether you're at home with your family, at work, at the grocery store, or hiking on a nature trail. While it may be something as simple as properly caring for cuts and scrapes, 
              it can also be a lifesaving tool that keeps someone alive until help arrives. That's why the importance of 
              first aid training should never be overlooked.


            </p>
            
            
            <h4> •	It Doesn't Take Long to Learn.  </h4>
           <p> 
            First Aid training can fit into everyone's busy schedule. 
            It only takes a few hours and it can give you the skills and confidence to respond to an emergency,
             take action, and, in critical situations, even save a life. You'll find classes that are designed 
             for the way you live and learn, with options available on weekdays and weekends in a variety of 
             formats (e.g., in-person, online-only, or blended learning).
             

          </p>

           <h4>  •	It Looks Good on a Resume. </h4> 
           <p>
            Even if your employer (or potential employer) doesn't require training like CPR, First Aid and others, 
            it still looks great on your resume. By enrolling in these types of classes, it shows that you took the 
            initiative to get valuable, lifesaving instruction. To add it to your resume, just create a “Special Skills” 
            or “Certifications” section and list it under there along with any relevant context. For instance, if you've had
             experience using first aid as a volunteer firefighter, lifeguard, babysitter or child caregiver, include that in a brief sentence.
