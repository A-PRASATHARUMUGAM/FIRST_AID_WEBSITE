<h2  class="para-title" > Why First Aid is Important </h2>

  <h4 class="para-points"> •	It Helps You Stay Prepared</h4> 
  
  <p class="para-1">
    The goal of first aid is twofold. First, it helps you recognize the signs that someone actually needs help and, 
    second, it prepares you to respond when minutes matter. Remember, an emergency can happen when you least expect it, whether you're at home with your family, at work, at the grocery store, or hiking on a nature trail. While it may be something as simple as properly caring for cuts and scrapes, 
    it can also be a lifesaving tool that keeps someone alive until help arrives. That's why the importance of 
    first aid training should never be overlooked.


  </p>
  
  
  <h4 class="para-points"> •	It Doesn't Take Long to Learn.  </h4>
  <p class="para-2"> 
  First Aid training can fit into everyone's busy schedule. 
  It only takes a few hours and it can give you the skills and confidence to respond to an emergency,
    take action, and, in critical situations, even save a life. You'll find classes that are designed 
    for the way you live and learn, with options available on weekdays and weekends in a variety of 
    formats (e.g., in-person, online-only, or blended learning).
    

</p>

  <h4  class="para-points">  •	It Looks Good on a Resume. </h4> 
  <p class="para-3">
  Even if your employer (or potential employer) doesn't require training like CPR, First Aid and others, 
  it still looks great on your resume. By enrolling in these types of classes, it shows that you took the 
  initiative to get valuable, lifesaving instruction. To add it to your resume, just create a “Special Skills” 
  or “Certifications” section and list it under there along with any relevant context. For instance, if you've had
    experience using first aid as a volunteer firefighter, lifeguard, babysitter or child caregiver, include that in a brief sentence.

      <h2 class="para-title" >The DRSABCD action plan</h2>
      <p class="para-4">If you have completed a first aid course, you will be familiar with the DRSABCD action plan. You can remember them by thinking “Doctor’s ABCD” for DRS ABCD. <br>
      Each letter is a prompt for the actions to take when first aid is needed.</p>
